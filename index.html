            <p class="about_paragraph">Hey! My name is Austin Cumberlander and Iâ€™m 25 years old. Iâ€™m originally from Jackson, TN, but Iâ€™m currently living in Nashville. I recently enrolled in the Nashville Software School in the hopes of becoming a full stack web developer. My hobbies include playing the guitar, watching netflix/hulu, playing xbox and ps4, and of course, as youâ€™ve obviously probably guessed by now, I love taking long walks on the beachâ€¦ Thatâ€™s my jam â€” thatâ€™s my entire reason for livingâ€¦ <br>One of these things is a complete lie. Can you guess which one??? Woah.. ðŸ˜³</p>

            <img class="dino" src="http://islanublar.jurassicworld.com/media/dinosaurs/apatosaurus/apatosaurus-info-graphic.png" alt="">
            <p class="dino_paragraph">This is an image of the apatosaurus. It's my favorite dinosaur because that's what Little Foot from "Land Before Time" was. I was a pretty big fan of those movies. That was my first introduction to dinosaurs as a kid. I also think it's pretty cool to think about how large this creature was. Growing upwards of 75ft tall, I'm sure they were a sight to see.</p>
